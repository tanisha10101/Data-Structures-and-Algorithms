# Data Structures in C++

This repository contains various C++ implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. It serves as a practice ground for understanding the working and implementation of data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and circular linked lists, as well as solving basic algorithmic problems.


## Project Structure

### Array Operations
- **Insertion_arr.cpp**: Demonstrates insertion operations in an array.
- **Deletion_arr.cpp**: Demonstrates deletion operations in an array.
- **Reverse_arr.cpp**: Reverses the elements of an array.
- **Arrays.cpp**: General array operations.

### Linked Lists
- **Singular_LL.cpp**: Implementation of a singly linked list.
- **Circular_LL.cpp**: Implementation of a circular linked list.
- **Doubly_LL.cpp**: Implementation of a doubly linked list.

### Stacks
- **Stack_LL.cpp**: Stack implementation using a linked list.
- **Stack_arr.cpp**: Stack implementation using an array.
- **Rev_str_stack.cpp**: Reverses a string using stack operations.

### Queues
- **Queue_LL.cpp**: Queue implementation using a linked list.
- **Queue_arr.cpp**: Queue implementation using an array.
- **Circ_queue_arr.cpp**: Circular queue implementation using an array.
- **Circ_queue_LL.cpp**: Circular queue implementation using a linked list.

___

### Practice Problems
- **Non_zero.cpp**: Identifies and processes non-zero elements.
- **Odd_eve.cpp**: Checks and processes odd and even numbers.
- **Pos_neg.cpp**: Separates positive and negative numbers.
- **Search.cpp**: Implements a search operation.
- **Practice.cpp**: Miscellaneous practice problems.
